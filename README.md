# Problem Setter Tool Box
A set of tools with the purpose of making the problem setter work easier!
For now only provides minimal features for C++, but is intended to grow!

## Simple Use Case
With the following chunk of code you create 100 data set files, each one containing a diferent pair of integers from 1 to 10.

    //declares a pstb object, which creates testcases on the directory "./input"
    ProblemSetterToolBox pstb(".\\input");
    for (int i=1; i <= 10; i++){
        for (int j=1; j <= 10; j++){
            auto inputFile = pstb.getNewProblemInputGenerator();
            (*inputFile) << i << " " << j << "\n";
        }
    }

The data sets will be created inside a folder called `input` of the actual directory, and they will be named 001.in, ... 100.in.
The __input folder__ must exists.


## Client Project Scheme
Here is the proposition of an scheme of a clients who use the ProblemSetterToolBox library.
The "Problem - coppelia" folder in the repository is an example of the scheme. Is the Test Cases Generator for the problem "Campeonato en Coppelia" of the IX Copa UO (http://coj.uci.cu/24h/problem.xhtml?pid=4221).

First, a base folder for each problem.

    - Base Folder (dir)
    |--- casesGenerator(dir)
    |--- solution (dir)
    |--- testcases (dir)
    |--- other_files
    
The casesGenerator folder is a CodeBlocks project, which uses directly ProblemSetterToolBox.

    - casesGenerator (dir)   
    |--- pstb (dir)          ; the objects of the library
    |--- casesGenerator.exe  ; executable of project
    |--- casesGenerator.cbp  ; codeblocks project
    |--- generate_output.bat ; this bat generated by the project
    |--- main.cpp            ; main source of project
    |--- solution.exe        ; this exe is generated by solution project
    |--- other_files

Finally, the solution folder is a codeblocks project, which outpus its executable to the casesGenerator folder.

    - solution (dir)
    |--- main.cpp            ; solution of the problem
    |--- solution.cbp        ; codeblocks project files
    |--- other files
